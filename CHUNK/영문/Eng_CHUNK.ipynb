Metrics and Targets29 \\nInvestors and other stakeholders need to understand how an organization measures and monitors its \\nclimate-related risks and opportunities. Access to the metrics and targets used by an organization \\nallows investors and other stakeholders to better assess the organization’s potential risk-adjusted \\nreturns, ability to meet financial obligations, general exposure to climate-related issues, and progress \\nin managing or adapting to those issues. \\nMetrics and Targets  \\nDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and \\nopportunities where such information is material. \\nRecommended \\nDisclosure a) \\nDisclose the metrics \\nused by the \\norganization to \\nassess climate-\\nrelated risks and \\nopportunities in \\nline with its strategy \\nand risk \\nmanagement \\nprocess. \\nGuidance for All Sectors \\nOrganizations should provide the key metrics used to measure and manage climate-\\nrelated risks and opportunities, as described in Tables A1.1 and A1.2 (pp. 75–76), as well \\nas metrics consistent with the cross-industry, climate-related metric categories described \\nin Table A2.1 (p. 79).30 Organizations should consider including metrics on climate-related \\nrisks associated with water, energy, land use, and waste management where relevant \\nand applicable.  \\nWhere climate-related issues are material, organizations should consider describing \\nwhether and how related performance metrics are incorporated into remuneration \\npolicies.  \\nWhere relevant, organizations should provide their internal carbon prices as well as \\nclimate-related opportunity metrics such as revenue from products and services \\ndesigned for a low-carbon economy.  \\nMetrics should be provided for historical periods to allow for trend analysis. Where \\nappropriate, organizations should consider providing forward-looking metrics for the \\ncross-industry, climate-related metric categories described in Table A2.1 (p. 79), \\nconsistent with their business or strategic planning time horizons. In addition, where not \\napparent, organizations should provide a description of the methodologies used to \\ncalculate or estimate climate-related metrics. \\nRecommended \\nDisclosure b) \\nDisclose Scope 1, \\nScope 2, and, if \\nappropriate, Scope \\n3 greenhouse gas \\n(GHG) emissions, \\nand the related \\nrisks. \\nGuidance for All Sectors \\nOrganizations should provide their Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions independent of \\na materiality assessment, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 GHG emissions and the related \\nrisks.31 All organizations should consider disclosing Scope 3 GHG emissions.32, 33  \\nGHG emissions should be calculated in line with the GHG Protocol methodology to allow \\nfor aggregation and comparability across organizations and jurisdictions.34 As \\nappropriate, organizations should consider providing related, generally accepted \\nindustry-specific GHG efficiency ratios.35 \\n \\n29  The Task Force’s Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans should be reviewed by organizations disclosing information under this \\nrecommendation. \\n30  Financial organizations may find it more difficult to quantify exposure to climate-related risks because of challenges related to portfolio \\naggregation and data availability. The Task Force suggests financial organizations provide qualitative and quantitative information, where data \\nand methodologies allow. \\n31  Emissions are a prime driver of rising global temperatures and, as such, are a key focal point of policy, regulatory, market, and technology \\nresponses to limit climate change. As a result, organizations with significant emissions are likely to be impacted more significantly by \\ntransition risk than other organizations. In addition, current or future constraints on emissions, either directly by emission restrictions or \\nindirectly through carbon budgets, may impact organizations financially. \\n32  The Task Force strongly encourages all organizations to disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions. While the Task Force recognizes the data and \\nmethodological challenges associated with calculating Scope 3 GHG emissions, it believes such emissions are an important metric reflecting \\nan organization’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities. For guidance on reporting Scope 3 GHG emissions, see the GHG \\nProtocol’s The Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. \\n33  When considering whether to disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions, organizations should consider whether such emissions are a significant \\nportion of their total GHG emissions. For example, see discussion of 40% threshold in the Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi’s) paper SBTi \\nCriteria and Recommendations, Version 4.2, April 2021, Section V, p. 10. \\n34  While challenges remain, the GHG Protocol methodology is the most widely recognized and used international standard for calculating GHG \\nemissions. Organizations may use national reporting methodologies if they are consistent with the GHG Protocol methodology. \\n35  For industries with high energy consumption, metrics related to emission intensity are important to provide. For example, emissions per unit \\nof economic output (e.g., unit of production, number of employees, or value-added) is widely used.  \\n\\n \\nImplementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures \\n22\\nA. \\nIntroduction \\n \\nB. \\nRecommendations \\n \\nC. \\nGuidance for All Sectors \\n \\nD. \\nSupplemental Guidance \\nfor the Financial Sector \\n \\nE. \\nSupplemental Guidance \\nfor Non-Financial Groups \\n \\nF. \\nFundamental Principles  \\nfor Effective Disclosure \\n \\nAppendices \\nMetrics and Targets  \\nDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and \\nopportunities where such information is material. \\nGHG emissions and associated metrics should be provided for historical periods to allow \\nfor trend analysis.

Other goals may include \\nefficiency or financial goals, financial loss tolerances, avoided GHG emissions through \\nthe entire product life cycle, or net revenue goals for products and services designed for \\na low-carbon economy.  \\nIn describing their targets, organizations should consider including the following: \\n‒ \\nwhether the target is absolute or intensity based; \\n‒ \\ntime frames over which the target applies; \\n‒ \\nbase year from which progress is measured; and \\n‒ \\nkey performance indicators used to assess progress against targets. \\nOrganizations disclosing medium-term or long-term targets should also disclose \\nassociated interim targets in aggregate or by business line, where available. \\nWhere not apparent, organizations should provide a description of the methodologies \\nused to calculate targets and measures.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nImplementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures \\n23\\nA. \\nIntroduction \\n \\nB. \\nRecommendations \\n \\nC. \\nGuidance for All Sectors \\n \\nD. \\nSupplemental Guidance \\nfor the Financial Sector \\n \\nE. \\nSupplemental Guidance \\nfor Non-Financial Groups \\n \\nF. \\nFundamental Principles  \\nfor Effective Disclosure \\n \\nAppendices \\n \\n \\n \\nD. \\nSupplemental \\nGuidance for the \\nFinancial Sector')"
